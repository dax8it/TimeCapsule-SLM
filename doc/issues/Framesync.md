    Real-Time Sync System & In-Memory State Explained
Let me break down how the real-time sync and in-memory state work in this AI frames system:
1. In-Memory State Architecture
Apply to Framesync.md
hashes
2. Real-Time Sync Flow
Yes
No
User edits frame
frames state updates
useEffect triggers in FrameGraphIntegration
Compare current vs previous state
Changes detected?
Sync to Knowledge Base
No action
Update tracking states
lastFrameIds & lastFrameStates updated
3. Change Detection Logic
Apply to Framesync.md
]
4. Multiple Data Sources Problem
The system has 4 competing data sources:
In-Memory State (frames array) - Current UI state
Knowledge Base - Real-time searchable storage
IndexedDB - Local persistence
localStorage - Fallback storage
5. The Race Condition Issue
Here's what happens when you navigate away and back:
Apply to Framesync.md
;
6. The Overwrite Problem
Apply to Framesync.md
data
7. Why Frame Names Revert
The sequence is:
‚úÖ KB has correct data: "f1"
‚úÖ Load from KB: sets frames to "f1"
‚ùå Real-time sync triggers: sees "new" change
‚ùå Syncs with stale data: overwrites KB with "New AI Frame"
‚ùå UI updates: shows stale data
8. The Solution Approach
We need to:
Disable real-time sync during KB loading
Properly initialize the tracking states after KB load
Prevent race conditions between data sources
Apply to Framesync.md
data
This would prevent the real-time sync from immediately overwriting the KB data with stale information.
Would you like me to implement this fix?


# Solution 
The Real Issue:
The real-time sync system is perfect. The problem is that when we load from Knowledge Base, we're not properly initializing the tracking states that the real-time sync uses to detect changes.
üéØ The Solution (Keep Real-Time Sync):
The issue is in the loadFramesFromKnowledgeBase function. When we load frames from KB, we need to immediately update the real-time sync tracking states so it knows this is the "baseline" and doesn't think it's a new change.
Fix 1: Initialize Tracking States After KB Load
In page.tsx, after loading from KB, we need to tell the real-time sync component: "These are the current frames, don't sync them again."
Apply to Framesync.md
;
Fix 2: Update Real-Time Sync to Listen for KB Load
In FrameGraphIntegration.tsx, add an event listener to properly initialize tracking when KB loads:
Apply to Framesync.md
;
Fix 3: Add Small Delay to Prevent Race Condition
In the real-time sync useEffect, add a small guard:
Apply to Framesync.md
;
üéØ Why This Works:
Keeps real-time sync intact - No changes to the core sync logic
Prevents false positives - Tracking states properly initialized after KB load
Maintains Google Docs-like behavior - Real-time sync still works for actual changes
Fixes the navigation issue - KB loaded data won't be overwritten
üöÄ The Result:
‚úÖ Real-time sync continues to work perfectly for actual edits
‚úÖ KB loading properly initializes tracking states
‚úÖ No race condition between KB load and real-time sync
‚úÖ Frame names persist correctly after navigation
This solution works WITH your real-time sync system, not against it. Want me to implement these 3 small additions?
