## Content Generation Guidelines

### Writing Style Standards

#### Clarity and Accessibility
- **Use Simple Language**: Avoid unnecessary jargon
- **Define Technical Terms**: Always explain before using
- **Short Sentences**: Easier to follow and understand
- **Active Voice**: More direct and engaging

#### Engagement Techniques
- **Personal Address**: Use "you" to create connection
- **Encouraging Tone**: Build confidence and motivation
- **Progress Indicators**: Show advancement through content
- **Interactive Elements**: Checkboxes, exercises, "your turn" sections

#### Practical Focus
- **Working Examples**: Always provide code that runs
- **Real-World Context**: Explain why concepts matter
- **Immediate Application**: Let learners try concepts right away
- **Error Handling**: Prepare for common mistakes

### Code Example Standards

#### Code Quality Requirements
```python
# Example of well-formatted tutorial code
def convert_onnx_to_pytorch(onnx_model_path, output_path):
    """
    Convert ONNX model to PyTorch format
    
    Args:
        onnx_model_path (str): Path to ONNX model file
        output_path (str): Where to save PyTorch model
    
    Returns:
        torch.nn.Module: Converted PyTorch model
    """
    # Step 1: Load ONNX model
    onnx_model = onnx.load(onnx_model_path)
    
    # Step 2: Convert to PyTorch (using onnx2pytorch library)
    pytorch_model = ConvertModel(onnx_model)
    
    # Step 3: Save the converted model
    torch.save(pytorch_model.state_dict(), output_path)
    
    return pytorch_model

# Usage example:
model = convert_onnx_to_pytorch("model.onnx", "model.pth")
print("Conversion completed successfully!")
```
