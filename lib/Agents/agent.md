- Assess prior knowledge from user questions and statements
- Determine appropriate difficulty level for content
- Identify knowledge gaps and prerequisites

#### 3. Curriculum Designer Agent
**Specialty**: Create structured learning paths
- Design modular curriculum with logical progression
- Establish prerequisite relationships between topics
- Create learning objectives for each module
- Plan difficulty progression from basic to advanced

#### 4. Tutorial Generator Agent
**Specialty**: Create detailed instructional content
- Generate step-by-step tutorials and explanations
- Create practical examples and code samples
- Develop hands-on exercises and practice problems
- Design self-assessment checkpoints

#### 5. Content Formatter Agent
**Specialty**: Structure and format learning content
- Create consistent learning content templates
- Format content for optimal readability and engagement
- Design interactive elements and progress tracking
- Ensure accessibility and mobile compatibility

## Agent Coordination Protocol

### Phase 1: Analysis
1. **Conversation Analysis Agent** processes input content
2. **Level Assessment Agent** evaluates user expertise
3. Both agents share findings with Coordinator

### Phase 2: Design
1. **Curriculum Designer Agent** creates learning path structure
2. **Tutorial Generator Agent** develops detailed content
3. **Content Formatter Agent** structures final output

### Phase 3: Validation
1. Coordinator reviews all agent outputs
2. Cross-validates consistency and completeness
3. Integrates findings into final learning research report

## Agent Communication Standards

### Data Exchange Format
```json
{
  "agentId": "string",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601",
  "phase": "analysis|design|validation",
  "content": {
    "findings": {},
    "recommendations": {},
    "metadata": {}
  },
  "confidence": "0.0-1.0",
  "nextActions": []
}
```

### Quality Assurance
