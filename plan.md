- Implemented order preservation in drag & drop operations
- Enhanced Knowledge Base sync with complete metadata support
- Real-time bidirectional synchronization between DeepResearch and AI-Frames pages

### âœ… Phase 3: User Limits & UI Consistency

## Latest Feature: Clear All AI-Frames with KB Sync âœ…

### New Functionality Added
**Clear All AI-Frames Button:**
- Added "Clear All" button to AI-Frames page header next to Import/Export buttons
- Red styling to indicate destructive action, disabled when no frames exist
- Confirmation dialog warns users about permanent deletion and KB removal

**Enhanced Frame Management:**
- `handleClearAllFrames()` function provides comprehensive clearing:
  - Clears all AI frames from local state (`setFrames([])`)
  - Removes all AI-Frame documents from Knowledge Base via VectorStore
  - Clears related localStorage data (`ai_frames_timecapsule`, `timecapsule_combined`)
  - Resets UI state (graph, chapters, concepts, current frame index)
  - Provides detailed user feedback via chat messages
  
**Knowledge Base Integration:**
- Searches for and removes all documents with `source: 'ai-frames'`
- Deletes individual AI-Frame documents by ID (`aiframe-{frameId}`)
- Handles cleanup of any orphaned AI-Frame documents
- Comprehensive error handling for failed deletions

**Cross-Page Synchronization:**
- Dispatches `aiframes-cleared` event to notify other pages
- Includes metadata about cleared frames (count, BubblSpace ID, TimeCapsule ID)
- Analytics tracking for clear operations and error reporting

### User Experience
- **Clear All Button**: Prominently placed in header with destructive styling
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Warns about permanent deletion and KB impact
- **Progress Feedback**: Detailed chat messages about clearing progress
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling with specific error messages
- **State Reset**: Complete UI reset to fresh state after clearing

### Technical Implementation
1. **Local State Clearing**: All frame-related state variables reset
2. **Knowledge Base Cleanup**: Systematic deletion of all AI-Frame documents
3. **Storage Cleanup**: localStorage entries removed 
4. **Event Broadcasting**: Other pages notified of clearing action
5. **Analytics Integration**: Feature usage and error tracking

This feature provides users with a clean way to start fresh while ensuring complete synchronization between the UI state and Knowledge Base storage. 

## Latest Feature: AI-Frames Create Button Fix âœ…

### Issue Resolution
**Problem:** The "Create Frame" button on AI-Frames page was completely non-functional - clicking it produced no response or dialog.

**Root Cause:** Radix UI Dialog component was failing to render due to z-index and positioning issues, even though button clicks and state changes were working correctly.

**Solution:** Replaced dialog-based creation with direct inline form approach:
- Added `showCreationForm` state to control form visibility
- Modified empty state component to conditionally render creation form
- Created comprehensive inline form with all necessary fields:
  - Learning Goal (textarea)
  - Video URL (input with validation)
  - Start Time/Duration (number inputs)
  - Cancel/Create buttons with loading states
- Integrated with existing `handleCreateFrame()` function

### Technical Implementation
**State Management:**
- Added `showCreationForm` boolean state
- Replaced problematic `setShowCreateFrame` with `setShowCreationForm`
- Fixed all remaining linter errors from state variable rename

**UI/UX Enhancement:**
- Form appears directly in main content area when "Create Frame" clicked
- Clean, integrated creation experience without modal complexity
- Proper form validation and error handling
- Loading states during frame creation
- Responsive design for mobile compatibility

**Code Quality:**
- Removed all problematic dialog-related code
- Fixed 4 linter errors from incomplete state variable migration
- Maintained existing functionality while improving user experience

### User Experience
- **Immediate Functionality**: Create button now works reliably
- **Streamlined Process**: Direct form approach eliminates dialog issues
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear form states and loading indicators
- **Error Prevention**: Input validation and proper error messages
- **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive design for all screen sizes

### Testing Results
- âœ… "Create Frame" button now functional
- âœ… Form validation working correctly
- âœ… Frame creation integrates with existing system
- âœ… No linter errors remaining
- âœ… Proper state management throughout

This fix resolves the critical issue preventing users from creating new AI frames and provides a more streamlined creation experience.
