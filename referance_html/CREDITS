The beautiful mathematical fish animation algorithm was originally developed and shared by @yuruyurau on X (Twitter). This implementation adapts their compact JavaScript code into an interactive p5.js live coding environment with Monaco Editor.

## Implementation

- Interactive editor interface and p5.js adaptation
- Live coding environment setup
- Canvas integration and visualization framework

## Libraries Used

- **p5.js** - Creative coding library for canvas graphics
- **Monaco Editor** - Code editor component
- **Babel Standalone** - JavaScript transpilation
