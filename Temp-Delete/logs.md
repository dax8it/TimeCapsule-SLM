Okay, let's see. The user wants to know the best project by Rutwik. The available documents are 8 chunks, and I need to check what tools are available. The tools are DataInspector, PlanningAgent, PatternGenerator, etc. The current status shows that DataInspector is needed to analyze the documents, and the user's query is about finding the best project, which suggests that the first step is filtering documents.

Since the goal is to find the best project, the first action should be to use DataInspector to filter the documents. That makes sense because without filtering, the data might not be relevant. The user hasn't called any other tools yet, so starting with DataInspector is the right move. After that, maybe the next step would be to use PlanningAgent to create an execution plan,...

DataInspectorAgent.ts:1378 🎯 Technical terms LLM response: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user asked, "give the best project by Rutwik." So first, I need to find the document that mentions Rutwik. Looking at the DOCUMENT 1, it's Rutwik Shinde. The resume mentions his projects. Let me check the content again.

In DOCUMENT 1, Rutwik's experience includes Full Stack AI Developer, Ai Edx (Remote) from 01/2024 – Present. He built frontend architecture, developed secure authentication systems, integrated Git Hub API, Razorpay, Eleven Labs, Web Sockets, AWS Lambda, Dynamo DB, S3. Then he's involved in other projects like e-commerce platforms, inventory systems, and product listings. Also, he's a Full Stack Developer Intern with Priyam IT Services.

So the key points here are that Rutwik is involved in several projects. The best project would be the one he's most active in. The document mentions he's a Full Stack AI Developer, which is a project. Also, he's involved in building e-commerce platforms and inventory systems. The user wants the best project, so the answer should mention the specific project he's most active in. The document doesn't mention any specific project name, just his role. So the best answer is that he's involved in Full Stack AI Developer and e-commerce projects. The answer should list these as relevant terms.

The PlanningAgent creates an execution strategy, which is necessary for creating the best project. Since the user's goal is to answer the query, the PlanningAgent's plan would guide us towards the best project. The pattern generator might be used for content, but they haven't been called yet. But since the user is asking for the best project, the execution strategy from PlanningAgent would be the priority. So I should call PlanningAgent here.

The execution plan is to proceed with Extractor next, so the next step is to call the Extractor tool to extract Rutwik's projects.

First, I need to check if any other agents are already called. The PatternGenerator was already used, and the DataInspector did their analysis. The planning agent was done, so the main steps are done. Now, the next step is to use the Extractor to get the data. The reasoning is that without extracting data, we can't proceed, so calling Extractor is necessary. Finally, the remaining pipeline is Extractor followed by Synthesis, so the answer should be...
