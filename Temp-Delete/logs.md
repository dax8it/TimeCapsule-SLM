Okay, let's see. The user wants me to answer their query about "the best project by Rutwik." They mentioned available documents are 8 chunks, and I need to call the right tool first.

First, I need to check the available tools. The DataInspector is the one that filters documents. Since the user hasn't called any agents yet, and they need to analyze the documents, the next step should be DataInspector. That tool is required to analyze the documents, which are the core of any project. After that, the PlanningAgent can be used if the execution plan is set up, but in this case, the user hasn't called the PlanningAgent yet. So the correct first step is to call DataInspector to analyze the available documents.

DataInspectorAgent.ts:1378 🎯 Technical terms LLM response: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the best project by Rutwik. First, I need to look at the document content provided.

Looking at the document, there's a resume entry for Rutwik Shinde. The project mentions him as a Full Stack Developer, and he's involved in several projects. The projects listed are:

- Full Stack AI Developer, Ai Edx (Remote) 01/2024 – Present
- Full Stack Developer Intern, Priyam IT Services (Pune) 06/2022 – 01/2024

So, the projects he's part of are the AI developer and the intern. The user is asking for the best project, so I need to identify which of these is considered the best. Since the document mentions his projects as part of his experience, but the exact nature of the projects isn't specified beyond the roles. 

The key terms here are "Best" and "Project." However, the document doesn't provide specific details about which project is the best. It just states his role and projects he's been involved in. There's no information about the quality or ranking of these projects. 

In the EXTRACTION STRATEGY, I need to focus on specific terms. The user's query is about the best project, so the relevant terms would be the projects he's listed. But since there's no specific mention of which project is best, maybe the answer is that there's no specific project mentioned. However, the user might be expecting to know that he's involved in the AI project as an intern or full stack developer. 

Wait, but the user is asking for the best project, so maybe the answer is that the best project is the one he's currently with, but since the document doesn't specify which, maybe it's better to state that the best project is the one he's been in, but the exact details are not clear. 

Alternatively, if the projects are considered as part of his experience, but the user wants the best project, perhaps the answer is that he's involved in multiple projects, but the best is not specified. However, the user might be expecting to know that he's part of the AI project. 

But according to the instructions, if the query doesn't need a category, write "none." Since the user's query is about the best project, but the document doesn't specify, maybe the answer is that there's no specific project mentioned. But the initial documents mention his projects and roles. 

Wait, the user's query is "give the best project by Rutwik." The document mentions his projects but doesn't specify which. So the answer would be that the best project is not clearly defined, or that he's involved in multiple projects, but the exact best is unknown. 

But in the EXTRACTION STRATEGY, I need to extract specific terms. Since the user is asking for the best project, but there's no specific term, maybe the answer is that there's no specific project mentioned. However, the document does mention his projects. Maybe the answer is that he's involved in multiple projects, but the best is not specified. 

But the user might be expecting that the best project is the AI project as an intern. However, the document says "Full Stack Developer Intern, Priyam IT Services (Pune) 06/2022 – 01/2024." So maybe the best project is the intern's role. 

But the user is asking for the best project. So perhaps the answer is that he's involved in the AI project as an intern, but since the document doesn't specify which, maybe the answer is that there's no specific project mentioned. However, the initial documents mention his projects and roles. 

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me re-examine the document. The resume entry says he's a Full Stack Developer, and the projects he's been involved in are listed with the roles. So the projects he's part of are the AI and intern roles. If the user is asking for the best project, maybe the answer is that the best project is the AI project, but since the document doesn't specify which, maybe the answer is that the best project is not clearly defined. However, the user's query is straightforward, so the answer should be based on the available information. Since the document provides that he's involved in multiple projects, but the best isn't specified, maybe the answer is that there's no specific project mentioned. 

But the instructions say to extract terms from the document content. Since the projects are listed, but no specific project is mentioned as best, perhaps the answer is that there's no specific project mentioned. However, the user might be expecting that the best project is the AI project. 

Wait, maybe the answer is that he's involved in the AI project as an intern, so the best project is that. But the document doesn't say which project, just his role. 

This is a bit of a dilemma. The user's query is straightforward, and the document provides information about his projects and roles. The best project is likely the one he's currently with, but since the document doesn't specify, maybe the answer is that there's no specific project mentioned. But the instructions say to extract terms from the document, so even if there's no specific term, we should list what's available. 

In this case, the relevant terms would be the projects he's listed, but since the user is asking for the best, maybe the answer is that the best project is the one he's currently with, but the exact details are not clear. However, the documents mention that he's been involved in those projects, so maybe the answer is that the best project is the AI and intern projects. But the user is asking for the best, so perhaps the answer is that the best project is the AI project as an intern. 

But since the document doesn't specify which, maybe the answer is that there's no specific project mentioned. However, the instructions say to extract terms from the document, so even if there's no specific term, we should list what's available. 

In conclusion, the relevant terms are the projects he's listed, but since the user is asking for the best, the answer would be that there's no specific project mentioned. However, the documents mention his projects, so maybe the answer is that the best project is the one he's part of, but since the exact details are not clear, the answer is that there's no specific project mentioned.

The next step should be to create an execution strategy using PlanningAgent.

After that, if the plan is validated, they might proceed with PatternGen...

Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the best project by Rutwik. From the available data, I need to check which tools have been used and which are still available. 

First, the data says that DataInspector has already analyzed the documents. Then, the PlanningAgent created the execution plan, and PatternGenerator and Extractor have generated 24 patterns. Also, the SynthesisCoordinator is already running, and the DataAnalyzer is not yet called. The user's goal is to answer the query, so the next step should be to use the tools that can help with that.

Since DataAnalyzer is needed for data processing after extraction, and the next goal is to synthesize the data, the correct tool here would be the DataAnalyzer. But wait, the Execution Plan says to use the plan if available, which ...

Since the execution plan is active, and all steps are completed, the next logical step is to call the SynthesisCoordinator to combine the data. That way, the final answer is ready.
