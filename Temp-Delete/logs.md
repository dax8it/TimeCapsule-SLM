How to Achieve More Effective RL? We demonstrate RL works pretty well in mathematical reasoning tasks. We also provide a unified paradigm to understand different representative training methods. Within this paradigm, all methods are conceptualized as either direct or simplified RL techniques. As summarized in Equation 5, there exist three key components: Data Source, Algorithm, and Reward Function. We provide some potential future directions about the three components. Data Source Data source is the raw material of all training methods. In the context of RL, we specifically refer to the data source as the unlabeled questions with the outputs sampled from the policy model. In this paper, we only use the questions from the instruction tuning stage and a naive nucleus sampling to sample outputs. We think this is a potential reason that our RL pipeline only improves the Maj@K performance. In the future, we will explore our RL pipeline on out-of-distribution question prompts, in conjunction withadvanced sampling (decoding) strategies, like those based on" (score: 80%)

This research demonstrates that RL-trained LLMs can serve as effective tools for complex engineering optimization, potentially transforming engineering domains beyond software development. 1 Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly transformed software engineering practices, yielding quantifiable improvements in code generation, debugging processes, and documentation development. Studies demonstrate productivity enhancements of 55% on various software development task completion Git[1]. Despite these documented efficiency gains in computational domains, LLMs’ applications to mechanical, aerospace, civil, and other physical engineering disciplines remain underdeveloped. This disparity raises a fundamental research question: Can LLMs function as effective tools for engineering tasks beyond software development? To explore this hypothesis, we selected high-powered rocketry as an ideal test domain for several compelling reasons. First, rocket design represents a well-bounded yet complex engineering challenge" (score: 30%)
DataAnalysisAgent.ts:228 ✅ Keeping relevant item: "superior computational efficiency (Fawzi et al., 2022). Similarly, Alpha Dev[7] optimized low-level sorting algorithms beyond human-designed solutions, and Alpha Chip[9] enhanced semiconductor design through systematic exploration of parameter spaces. These systems primarily leverage traditional RL methodologies with domain-specific reward structures. Our approach diverges by employing language models as the base policy, leveraging their baseline engineering knowledge and physical reasoning capabilities. This integration of structured domain priors with reinforcement learning enables more sample-efficient optimization while maintaining domain flexibility, addressing a fundamental limitation of previous approaches that require extensive task-specific engineering. 3 Methodology 3.1 Simulation Env Our simulations were built on Rocket Py, a high-fidelity trajectory simulation library for high-power rocketry. Rocket Py provides a complete 6 degrees of freedom (6-DOF) simulation framework that accounts for variable mass effects, aerodynamic forces, and parachute descent phases with exceptional accuracy. The library has been validated against real-world flight data, demonstrating relative errors of less than 2% for apogee predictions across multiple documented test flights[2]. For our research, we enhanced Rocket Py with custom design rule checks (DRCs) and timeout mechanisms to address common failure modes observed during initial testing. DRCs included basic constraints including verification that body diameter exceeded motor diameter and that body length was greater than motor length to ensure proper component integration. These additions prevent simulation failures caused by physically impossible configurations and terminate excessively long computations that often result from unrealistic rocket parameters. To enable LLMs to interface with the simulation environment, we developed a" (score: 80%)

While the weighting and selection criteria for each scoring component were chosen heuristically, they were designed to approximate the evaluation frameworks used in actual rocket competitions. 3.2.1 Target Altitude Challenge The first task was inspired by the 10,000-foot category of the Spaceport America Cup, an international collegiate rocket engineering competition. In this event, teams must design rockets that reach as close as possible to the target altitude while ensuring safe recovery and operational integrity. Our reward function was designed to capture the essential performance metrics of this competition, focusing on flight performance aspects that could be simulated. The reward balanced multiple objectives with the following components: •Altitude Accuracy (50%): A linear reward based on the percentage difference between the achieved apogee and the target altitude" (score: 30%)

Despite strong baseline capabilities and consistent improvement trends, all LLMs ultimately fell short of human performance in iterative design optimization. We next investigated whether additional iterations would enable models to surpass human performance. Our 30-iteration experiment with Claude 3.7 and o1 (Figure 2 yielded particularly insightful results about the models’ improvement limitations. Both models plateaued below the human maximum despite extensive iteration opportunities. Claude 3.7 stabilized around 75.73, coming close to but never surpassing the human record of 76.57, while o1 plateaued at a lower 67.7. This persistent gap indicates that neither model could match the human level performance despite having triple the iteration cycles compared to the baseline experiment. We also evaluated "best-of-10" sampling alongside our primary methods, observing significant performance gains across models. The improvements varied by model: GPT-4o showed the largest relative improvement, gaining 12.89 points to reach 56.51; o1 increased from 60.57 to 68.3; Claude 3.7 rose from 62.14 to 69.69; and Deepseek v3 improved from 57.3 to 63.28.

While this provides a fair comparison, we acknowledge that human experts with additional iterations or collaborative environments might develop superior solutions.

We observe that reasoning-focused models (o1) outperform foundation models (GPT-4o), suggesting that further scaling of the reasoning model paradigm could yield additional performance improvements. Test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) represents another promising axis for scaling compute to enhance performance. Beyond providing an incremental boost in specific domains, TTRL offers a methodology for extending performance boundaries in individual domains, potentially previewing future capabilities of large language models. 6.2 Why use LLMs for RL?

 ✅ Agent execution validated: DataAnalyzer exists in registry - allowing as potential intelligent addition
 ⚠️ Agent DataAnalyzer already called, skipping to prevent redundant processing

 📋 Agent DataAnalyzer was already executed successfully.
 📊 Current Pipeline Status: COMPLETED ✅ - All 3 planned steps executed
 💡 Next Step Guidance: 
📊 **PIPELINE PROGRESS**:
✅ PatternGenerator → ✅ Extractor → ✅ SynthesisCoordinator

✅ **All planned steps completed** - Pipeline execution finished.
Consider: web-search.

 🎯 Recommended Next Action: Continue to next agent in pipeline
