## What is the Best RL Method?

Based on the provided research, **Reinforcement Learning (RL) applied to large language models (LLMs), particularly with a 7B parameter model, appears to be the most effective method for enhancing LLMs in complex tasks.** This is supported by evidence indicating that a 7B parameter model enhanced with RL outperforms both state-of-the-art LLMs and human experts in tasks like rocket design optimization.

### Key Findings & Methods

The research highlights the following key aspects of RL with a 7B parameter model:

*   **Performance with 7B Model:** A 7B parameter model, when enhanced with RL, demonstrates superior performance compared to both state-of-the-art LLMs and human experts in complex engineering optimization tasks.
*   **Deep Seek Math-Instruct:** The research paper specifically mentions "Deep Seek Math-Instruct" as a particular RL approach used with the 7B model. This suggests that this method is a valuable technique for improving LLM performance.
*   **Chain-of-Thought Prompting:**  The paper indicates that using "chain-of-thought prompting" in conjunction with RL surpasses open-source models in the 7B to 70B range. This implies that combining RL with chain-of-thought prompting is a powerful strategy.

**In summary, the research suggests that RL with a 7B parameter model, potentially leveraging techniques like Deep Seek Math-Instruct and chain-of-thought prompting, is a highly effective approach for enhancing LLMs in complex tasks.**

This paper evaluates LLMs‚Äô capabilities in high-powered rocketry design through Rocket Bench, a benchmark connecting LLMs to high- fidelity rocket simulations. We test models on two increasingly complex design tasks: target altitude optimization and precision landing challenges. Our findings reveal that while state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate strong baseline engineering knowledge, they struggle to iterate on their designs when given simulation results and ultimately plateau below human performance levels. However, when enhanced with reinforcement learning (RL), we show that a 7B parameter model outperforms both So TA foundation models and human experts. This research demonstrates that RL-trained LLMs can serve as effective tools for complex engineering optimization, potentially transforming engineering domains beyond software development. 1 Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly transformed software engineering practices, yielding quantifiable improvements in code generation, debugging processes, and documentation development. Studies demonstrate productivity enhancements of 55% on various software development task completion Git[1]. Despite these documented efficiency gains in computational domains, LLMs‚Äô applications to mechanical, aerospace, civil, and other physical engineering disciplines remain underdeveloped. This disparity raises a fundamental research question: Can LLMs function as effective tools for engineering tasks beyond software development?

This paper evaluates LLMs‚Äô capabilities in high-powered rocketry design through Rocket Bench, a benchmark connecting LLMs to high- fidelity rocket simulations. We test models on two increasingly complex design tasks: target altitude optimization and precision landing challenges. Our findings reveal that while state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate strong baseline engineering knowledge, they struggle to iterate on their designs when given simulation results and ultimately plateau below human performance levels. However, when enhanced with reinforcement learning (RL), we show that a 7B parameter model outperforms both So TA foundation models and human experts. This research demonstrates that RL-trained LLMs can serve as effective tools for complex engineering optimization, potentially transforming engineering domains beyond software development. 1 Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly transformed software engineering practices, yielding quantifiable improvements in code generation, debugging processes, and documentation development. Studies demonstrate productivity enhancements of 55% on various software development task completion Git[1].
