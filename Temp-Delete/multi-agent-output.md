Okay, let's break this down. The user asked for the best project by Rutvik based on the provided data. The sample content mentions "Document: undefined (18 chunks available)", which suggests there's no specific information or projects listed. The data areas listed include projects named after Rutvik, their technologies, metrics, and achievements. However, since the content is undefined, there's no actual data to extract. Therefore, there are no relevant projects or information to provide. The answer should reflect that there are no content areas or projects matching the query.

Okay, the user wants to know the best project by Rutvik based on the provided data. First, I need to check the data. The sample content mentions "Document: undefined (18 chunks available)", which suggests that there's no specific information. The user also provided content areas like projects named after Rutvik, technologies, metrics, and achievements. But since the data is undefined, there's no way to extract any projects. Therefore, there are no relevant projects or details to answer the query. The answer should state that there are no content areas or projects matching the request.
