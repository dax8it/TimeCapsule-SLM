   💭 AI Reasoning:
   Okay, let me break down the user's query and the data samples provided.
   
   First, the user's question is asking for the top 3 speed runs from Tyler's blog. The data samples are all blog posts. Sample 1 is a detailed blog post about training effectiveness and hyperparameters. Sample 2 mentions speedrun results from people like Keller, Jordan, and others. Sample 3 talks about training with GPUs and performance metrics like token rate and speedups. 
   
   So, the data seems to be a blog post, as all the samples are about training processes and speed runs. 
   
   For the information relevant to the user's query, Tyler's blog post includes details about training effectiveness, hyperparameters, and speedrun results. The user wants speed runs, so the top 3 would be the top results mentioned in the blog. 
   
   There's mention of speedrun times and metrics, but the user is asking specifically for the top 3 runs. In the data, they list some results, so the relevant information would be those speeds. 
   
   Regarding performance metrics, sample 2 has "221k tokens/sec" and a speedrun result from multiple people. So, the user can extract those numbers as part of the top 3 speed runs.
   
   Finally, to extract the relevant information, I need to identify the specific numbers and the top 3 results mentioned. The answer should be specific, mentioning those points and the type of data.

   💭 AI Reasoning:
   Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to find the top 3 speed runs from Tyler's blog, but the data includes completion times and performance metrics. The task is to create specific extraction strategies with clear questions.
   
   First, for what to look for, I need to focus on completion times. So, the main elements are the top 3 speed run completion times. Avoiding performance metrics because those are the ones that need to be filtered out. 
   
   Then, how to identify right information. The user wants the top 3, so the extraction strategies should prioritize that. Maybe use a filter that extracts only the speed run completion times. Also, structure the answer to present the top 3 without any performance details. Need to make sure that the strategies are specific and direct, not too vague.
   📝 Summary: Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to find the top 3 speed runs from Tyler's blog, but the data...
