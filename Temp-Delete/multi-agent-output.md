I see two issues here:

  1. The quality assessment error: this.registry.getAgent is not a function - this is a method call issue
  in the Orchestrator
  2. The extraction issue: DataInspector extracted "reinforcement learning" instead of "GRPO" - showing
  the system is still getting generic terms

  Let me fix the first error - the registry access issue:

‚è∫ Read(src/lib/multi-agent/core/Orchestrator.ts)
  ‚éø  Read 15 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚è∫ I need to check how the registry is actually accessed in this class. Let me look at the constructor or
  other registry usages:

‚è∫ Search(pattern: "registry\|getAgent", path: "src/lib/multi-agent/core/Orchestrator.ts", output_mode:
        "content", head_limit: 5)
  ‚éø  Found 0 lines 

‚è∫ Search(pattern: "AgentRegistry\|this\.", path: "src/lib/multi-agent/core/Orchestrator.ts", output_mode:
        "content", head_limit: 10)
  ‚éø  Found 0 lines 

‚è∫ Let me check the beginning of the class to understand its structure:

‚è∫ Read(src/lib/multi-agent/core/Orchestrator.ts)
  ‚éø  Read 30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚è∫ Perfect! I can see the registry is properly declared as private registry: AgentRegistry at line 20. The
  issue is that I'm trying to call this.registry.getAgent() but I should check how other methods in this
  class access agents. Let me look for other instances where agents are accessed:

‚è∫ Search(pattern: "\.getAgent\|registry\.get", path: "src/lib/multi-agent/core/Orchestrator.ts",
        output_mode: "content", head_limit: 3)
  ‚éø  Found 0 lines 

‚è∫ Search(pattern: "registry", path: "src/lib/multi-agent/core/Orchestrator.ts", output_mode: "content",
        head_limit: 5)
  ‚éø  Found 5 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚è∫ Great! Now I can see the correct method call. The registry uses .get() and .has(), not .getAgent(). Let
  me fix this:

‚è∫ Update(src/lib/multi-agent/core/Orchestrator.ts)
  ‚éø  Updated src/lib/multi-agent/core/Orchestrator.ts with 1 addition and 1 removal
       1887            };
       1888          }
       1889    
       1890 -        const planningAgent = this.registry.getAgent('PlanningAgent');
       1890 +        const planningAgent = this.registry.get('PlanningAgent');
       1891          if (!planningAgent) {
       1892            return {
       1893              isAcceptable: true,

‚è∫ I also need to fix the same issue in the retry method:

‚è∫ Update(src/lib/multi-agent/core/Orchestrator.ts)
  ‚éø  Updated src/lib/multi-agent/core/Orchestrator.ts with 1 addition and 1 removal                       
       2059        context.sharedKnowledge.agentGuidance[agentName] = improvement;
       2060    
       2061        // Re-execute the agent
       2062 -      const agent = this.registry.getAgent(agentName);
       2062 +      const agent = this.registry.get(agentName);
       2063        if (agent) {
       2064          console.log(`üéØ Re-executing ${agentName} with improvement guidance: 
     ${improvement}`);
       2065          await agent.process(context);

‚è∫ Now let me address the second issue - the fact that DataInspector extracted "reinforcement learning"
  instead of "GRPO". This suggests the content sampling or prompt isn't working correctly. Looking at the
  log: üìã Extracted methods: ['reinforcement learning']

  The system extracted a generic concept instead of a specific method name. This means:
  1. Either "GRPO" wasn't in the content sample provided to the LLM
  2. Or the LLM prompt didn't instruct it properly to find specific method names

  Let me check if there are other quality control issues that need fixing, but first I should test if the
  registry fix resolves the immediate error.

  The intelligent quality control system should now work without the getAgent error, and when it detects
  that "reinforcement learning" is too generic for a query about "best RL method", it should trigger a
  retry with better guidance to DataInspector to extract specific method names like "GRPO".
