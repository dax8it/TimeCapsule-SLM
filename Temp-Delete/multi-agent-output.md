       "llmResponse": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking for the best project by Rutwik, and I need to analyze the provided document content to find patterns. Let's look at the samples.\n\nFirst, sample 1: Rutwik Shinde has a Software Developer role with GitHub info. The project mentions building a full frontend architecture and secure authentication. So, numbers here might be in the form of 01/2024 – Present, which includes the start and end dates. That's a measurable data structure, so I can extract the date range.\n\nSample 2 talks about using Next.js, Sanity CMS, and Mongo DB. The project mentions dynamic product listings, category filtering, and end-to-end order flow. The timeframes are in the format with \"•\" like \"•Built end-to-end order flow: cart, address input, checkout, payment, and order status tracking.\" So here, the timeframes are in a bullet point format, which is a specific structure. I can capture those bullet points.\n\nSample 3 has a question about GPT speedrun, which is a project, but the actual text is just a question, not a project. So maybe not relevant. Sample 4 mentions token speeds and training steps, which are numerical values. So the regex could capture those numbers.\n\nPutting it all together, the patterns should extract date ranges, bullet point timeframes, and numerical values like token speeds. Let me check if the samples actually show these. Yes, sample 1 has dates, sample 2 has bullet points, and sample 4 has numbers. So the regex patterns would be for date ranges, bullet point structure, and numerical values.\n</think>\n\n- /•\\s*([^\\n•]+)/g  \n- /Projects?:\\s*\\n([\\s\\S]*?)(?=\\n[A-Z]|$)/gi  \n- /[^\\d]+\\.?\\s*\\d+/g  \n\n**Reasoning**:  \n- **Date ranges**: Extracted from \"01/2024 – Present\" (start/end dates).  \n- **Project bullet points**: Captured from \"• Built end-to-end order flow...\" (structured in bullet format).  \n- **Numerical values**: Extracted from \"to 216k tokens/second\" and \"total number of training steps\" (measurable metrics)."
