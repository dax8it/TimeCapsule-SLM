   💭 AI Reasoning:
   Okay, let's see what the user needs here. They want to know the best project from Rutwik's CV. The user found three different sources, each with some project information.
   
   First, looking at Source 1, it mentions being a Full Stack AI Developer at Ai Edx. They used Next.js, Sanity CMS, and MongoDB. There's a lot of focus on backend development, integration with APIs, and some project mentions like real-time features and serverless services. Then, Source 2 also talks about using Next.js and Sanity CMS, but with more emphasis on product listings, order flow, and integration with Stripe and Razorpay. Source 3 seems similar to Source 1 but also includes serverless backend details.
   
   The key here is that the user wants the best project. Since both sources mention similar projects, but with different focus areas, the relevant information is that Rutwik has built a front-end architecture with Next.js, used backend technologies like AWS Lambda, and integrated various APIs. Also, they integrated with Stripe and Razorpay for payment gateways. The projects they've worked on include building an order flow system, which is a solid project.
   
   Wait, but how do we determine which project is best? The user might be looking for a specific project that's well-documented. Since both sources mention similar projects, but one has more details on backend integration and another on product management, maybe the best project is the one that combines backend development with product management, as that's a strong indicator of a well-rounded project. However, since the user asked for the best, they might be looking for a project that's either the front-end architecture or the backend services. But given the data, the best project is likely the one that integrates multiple technologies, which aligns with the user's query about finding the best project.

   💭 AI Reasoning:
   Okay, the user is asking for the best project from Rutwik's CV based on a technology-related ranking. Let me break this down.
   
   First, I need to figure out what Rutwik's CV typically includes. Typically, a CV lists projects, skills, and achievements. The user wants a project that's ranked in technology, so I should look for projects that are tech-oriented.
   
   Next, how to find relevant information? Since it's a CV, maybe the user can look through sections like Projects, Skills, or Experience. But since I don't have the actual CV, I need to think about common patterns or indicators in such projects.
   
   Technology projects often involve coding, programming languages, development tools, frameworks, or specific tech stacks. So, when looking for a project, I should check if there's a mention of programming languages or tech stack used. Also, the project might have a ranking based on the number of people involved, or the duration of the project, or the complexity.
   
   Another consideration is whether the project is actively developed or a recent one. If Rutwik is a current professional, their projects might be up-to-date. Also, the project might have a ranking based on the number of reviews or user ratings, which indicates popularity.
   
   I should also think about keywords like "best," "top," "highest," or "top project" that might indicate the relevance. Maybe the project is highlighted in a specific section, like Projects and Achievements, and has a high rating.
   
   Wait, but the user is looking for the best project, so maybe the ranking is based on factors like impact, quality, or contribution. So, when processing the CV, I should look for projects that are high in these indicators. For example, a project that is a top-tier tech stack, has high user engagement, or has a notable outcome.
   
   I need to make sure I'm not missing any possible patterns. Maybe the project's name, the tech involved, or the team's involvement. Also, checking if the project is part of a specific tech field, like AI, machine learning, or web development.
   
   Putting this all together, the relevant patterns would be looking for tech-specific projects, mentioning programming languages, high user ratings, active involvement, and recent or impactful outcomes.
