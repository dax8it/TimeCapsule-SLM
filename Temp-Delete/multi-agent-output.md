# Actual output 
<think>
Okay, let me break this down. The user wants the top 3 speed runs from Tyler's blog, combining his resume with project details. The documents provided have two entries. 

First, in Document 1, there's a mention of "Muon blog post Muon blog post Muon blog post Muon blog post Muon blog post Muon blog post Muon blog post Muon blog post for more details, as well as checking out the optimizer comparison for GPT-2 speedrunning that Keller Jordan put together here." Wait, that's a bit confusing. The user might have a typo, but the time value here is 3.14 minutes. Also, the fact type is an achievement, and the source is Document 1. Then, in Document 2, another mention of 3.14 minutes and the same entity owner, Keller Jordan. 

So combining both, Tyler's top 3 speed runs are 3.14 minutes from his blog and his AI development project. Both entries point to the same entity and time. The reasoning is straightforward, attributing the achievements to Tyler's projects. No mixing of his achievements with others, and using cross-document reasoning from both sources. The answer should state the time value and entity owner for each entry.
