   💭 AI Reasoning:
   Okay, let's see. The user wants to know about the best project from Rutwik's CV. They provided three different sources. 
   
   First, Source 1 and 3 mention Rutwik as a Full Stack AI Developer, with projects like building frontend architecture, integrating APIs, and designing a serverless backend. They also talk about using Next.js, Sanity CMS, and Mongo DB. There's a mention of AI-powered tools like a Course Generator, but that's part of the Personalized Course Generator section.
   
   Source 2 adds more projects: 10+ shops using their platform, dynamic product listings, end-to-end order flow, Stripe and Razorpay integration, user account management, and admin dashboard. Also, real-time order notifications and email confirmations. 
   
   So the user is asking for the best project. The best project could be something that's mentioned as the main focus or leading to the most recognition. From the sources, the main projects are building a front-end system, integrating APIs, and designing a backend with AWS Lambda. The AI-driven Course Generator is another point, but maybe that's part of the intern's experience. 
   
   Wait, but the user is looking for the best project. Since multiple sources mention similar projects, perhaps the most relevant is the Full Stack AI Developer project in Ai Edx, which is currently as an intern. But the user might be interested in the intern's experience. Alternatively, the best project could be the serverless backend as an intern's experience, as it's a significant part of their CV. 
   
   Also, considering the user's query, they might be looking for a project that showcases Rutwik's expertise in AI and web development. So the best projects are those that highlight both technical skills and project impact, like using Next.js, Sanity, and Mongo for scalability, or the AI Course Generator. 
   
   So the answer should list the most relevant projects from the sources, emphasizing the key skills and projects that align with the user's request. Make sure to mention the specific technologies and projects mentioned in each source to back up the answer.

   💭 AI Reasoning:
   Okay, the user is looking for information about the best project from Rutwik's CV and wants to know how to find relevant information. They mentioned that the data type is technology, so I need to focus on technology-related patterns or indicators.
   
   First, I should think about the structure of a CV. Typically, projects are listed in order of importance. Rutwik might have a project list that ranks them. So, the user needs to look for the highest-priority projects. Maybe the first or second project in the list is the best.
   
   Next, the user wants to find patterns or indicators. Could there be a specific keyword or term in the project description that indicates the best project? Like "most successful" or "best in the field"? Also, the user might want to see metrics like completion time or impact. These indicators would help rank the projects.
   
   Another angle is the time frame. If Rutwik is focusing on a specific industry, like tech, then mentioning the time frame in the project description could be useful. For example, "last 12 months" or "in recent years" would be indicators.
   
   Additionally, the user might want to see the outcome or outcome of the project. Metrics like "increased sales by X%" or "reached 100 customers" would indicate the success of the project.
   
   I should also consider the project's impact. If the project had a significant positive outcome, that would be a key indicator. Including those metrics in the CV would help the user rank them.
   
   Wait, but how do I know Rutwik's projects are in the tech field? Maybe the user is assuming that. But the user is asking based on the given data type, so I need to frame it in terms of technology. So, the answer should guide the user to look for the highest-priority projects, check for success metrics, and consider time frames.
   
   Also, think about industry-specific terminology. For example, in tech, terms like "software development" or "data analytics" would be relevant. Mentioning those could help the user identify the best projects.
   
   Putting it all together, the key patterns are looking for the highest-priority projects, success metrics, time frames, and industry-specific terms. That should help the user find relevant information.
