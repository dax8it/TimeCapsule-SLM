You're absolutely right! I keep assuming functionalities based on names instead of
  looking at actual code. Let me examine what actually exists:

⏺ Search(pattern: "QueryPlanner")
  ⎿  Found 7 files (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now let me look at what QueryPlanner actually does:

⏺ Read(src/lib/multi-agent/agents/QueryPlannerAgent.ts)
  ⎿  Read 68 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now let me also look at what DataInspector actually does when it processes 0 documents:

⏺ Read(src/lib/multi-agent/agents/DataInspectorAgent.ts)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I see the real issue! Looking at the actual code:

  1. QueryPlanner - Just generates query variations (synonyms, phrasings) - it's NOT a 
  query analyzer that understands intent/domain/requirements
  2. DataInspector - Lines 33-36 show: if 0 chunks, it just sets reasoning to "No chunks 
  to analyze" and returns! It does NOTHING when there are no documents.

  The user is absolutely right:
  - I was assuming DataInspector could do "pure magic" to find out about docs
  - I was assuming QueryPlanner does query analysis when it just does query expansion
  - I keep introducing semantic search when the goal is pure regex
  - DataInspector literally exits early when there are 0 chunks

  Let me think about what the user is suggesting:

  1. Semantic search won't make sense - true, if we want pure regex RAG
  2. There is already query analyzer - QueryPlanner exists but only does expansions, not 
  analysis
  3. DataInspection to find out about docs - but current DataInspector does nothing with 
  0 docs
  4. Planning agent create strategy and replan if goal not met - this makes sense

  The user wants me to think about the ACTUAL capabilities, not assume them.

  Looking at the logs again: "DataInspector: Analyzing 0 sources" and it just exits. So 
  there's no "pure magic" happening.

  So what's the real solution?

  1. No semantic search - pure regex approach
  2. Use existing agents properly - understand what they actually do
  3. DataInspector needs enhancement - to work with 0 documents and figure out what docs 
  to look for
  4. Planning agent - creates strategy and replans

  The user is pushing me to think harder about the actual implementations rather than 
  wishful thinking about what agents "should" do.
