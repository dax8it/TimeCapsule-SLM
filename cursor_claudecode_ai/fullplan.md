# Full Plan - AI Frames System Issues

## Active Issues

### Issue #004: Knowledge Base Management - Enhanced RAG Features
**Status**: üöÄ **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**  
**Priority**: HIGH - Feature Enhancement  
**Type**: UI/UX & Search Enhancement  
**Created**: 2025-07-21  
**Updated**: 2025-07-21  
**File**: [cursor_claudecode_ai/issues/Issue-004-Build-Dependencies-Fix.md](./issues/Issue-004-Build-Dependencies-Fix.md)

**Current Status**: 
- **System Analysis**: Complete analysis of existing KB Manager UI (15 docs, 3.72 KB)
- **Functional System**: RxDB + semantic search + model caching all working perfectly
- **UI Documentation**: Comprehensive specs with actual component analysis from screenshots
- **Test Coverage**: 7 test cases covering all existing functionality (6/7 passing)
- **Enhancement Plan**: Clear priorities for User Docs upload, advanced search, bulk operations

**Current System State**: 
- **User Docs**: 0 documents (upload UI ready for enhancement)
- **AI Frames**: 4 documents (working integration) 
- **System**: 11 documents (generated content)
- **Model Cache**: 23MB Xenova all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (cached and working)

**Next Session Goals**: 
- Configure Webpack to bundle 22MB Xenova model files at build time
- Implement lazy loading strategy (fast page load ‚Üí modal ‚Üí model ready)
- Update both AI Frames and Deep Research to use bundled models
- Eliminate duplicate model loading (save 22MB memory)
- Test performance improvements and bundle size impact

### Issue #003: Unified Storage Integration
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **PHASE 1 - 80% COMPLETE** (12/21 TODOs, 3 critical remain)  
**Priority**: HIGH - Next session resolution target  
**Type**: Architecture & Performance  
**Created**: 2025-01-18  
**Updated**: 2025-01-20  
**File**: [cursor_claudecode_ai/issues/Issue-003-Unified-Storage-Integration.md](./issues/Issue-003-Unified-Storage-Integration.md)

**Current Status**: 
- **Foundation Solid**: Unified storage architecture, auto-save indicators, dynamic properties all working
- **Critical Insight**: Specification was CORRECT - implementation was backwards 
- **Root Issue**: Synchronous saves blocking UI instead of optimistic updates (Excalidraw pattern)
- **TC-001 Compliance**: 3/6 criteria passing, frame-node sync issues remain

**Remaining Critical Blockers**: 
- **TODO-013**: Implement optimistic UI updates (instant UI + background saves)
- **TODO-014**: Fix frame-node synchronization after load  
- **TODO-015**: Implement event-driven state management

**Next Session Goal**: 
- Apply Excalidraw pattern: `setFrames(data)` ‚Üí instant UI, `queueSave(data)` ‚Üí background
- Expected: User types "f1" ‚Üí sees instantly ‚Üí refresh ‚Üí still "f1"
- Target: TC-001 passes 6/6 criteria ‚Üí Issue #003 RESOLVED
- Fixed change detection logic to trigger auto-save for new frames
- Reduced logging spam in window interface

**Next Steps**: 
- User testing of integrated unified storage system
- Verify Test 01 now passes with auto-save indicator
- Confirm frame persistence works without "Save Graph"
- Validate clean storage architecture (no old keys)

### Issue #002: Refactor page.tsx - Code Modularization  
**Status**: üîß In Progress (Partially Complete)  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Type**: Architecture & Code Quality  
**Created**: 2025-01-18  
**File**: [cursor_claudecode_ai/issues/Issue-002-Page-Refactoring.md](./issues/Issue-002-Page-Refactoring.md)

**Summary**: 
- `src/app/ai-frames/page.tsx` was too bloated and needed modularization
- Large file size affecting maintainability and code organization
- Multiple concerns mixed together (storage, UI, sync, validation)
- Difficult to debug and extend current monolithic structure

**Impact**: 
- Poor code maintainability and readability
- Difficult debugging and testing
- Increased development time for new features
- Higher risk of introducing bugs

**Progress Made**: 
- Created unified storage system (`unifiedStorage.ts`, `useUnifiedStorage.ts`)
- Simplified page.tsx by removing fragmented storage hooks
- Reduced complexity with single storage interface
- Improved type safety and error handling

**Next Steps**: 
- Continue modularization of remaining UI components
- Extract validation logic into separate modules
- Create separate components for dialog management
- Implement proper separation of concerns architecture

### Issue #001: AI Frames Multi-Layer Storage Data Consistency
**Status**: üîç Analysis Complete - Implementation Needed  
**Priority**: High  
**Type**: Data Corruption & Storage Architecture  
**Created**: 2025-01-18  
**File**: [cursor_claudecode_ai/issues/Issue-001-MultiLayer-Storage-Consistency.md](./issues/Issue-001-MultiLayer-Storage-Consistency.md)

**Summary**: 
- Frame data corruption during Graph State ‚Üí TimeCapsule sync
- Manage Knowledge shows partial information (missing graph connections)
- Frame replacement on refresh (f1 replaced by f2 content)
- Data inconsistency across localStorage, VectorStore, and Manage Knowledge

**Impact**: 
- Data loss and UI confusion
- Broken frame workflows
- Incomplete information in Manage Knowledge interface

**Next Steps**: 
- Leverage unified storage system from Issue #003 to fix consistency
- Fix Graph State ‚Üí TimeCapsule sync corruption
- Implement graph connection preservation in VectorStore
- Create dev mode testing framework for data consistency validation

### Issue #004: Attachment Change Detection Fix
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Type**: Bug Fix  
**Created**: 2025-01-18  
**File**: [cursor_claudecode_ai/issues/Issue-004-Attachment-Change-Detection.md](./issues/Issue-004-Attachment-Change-Detection.md)

**Summary**: 
- Fixed missing event listener for attachment property changes in unified storage system
- User workflow: create frame ‚Üí attach note ‚Üí change note name ‚Üí save status incorrect
- Root cause: useUnifiedStorage.ts missing listener for attachment-node-updated events
- Attachment changes were silently lost while showing false "saved" status

**Impact**: 
- Eliminated data loss for attachment modifications (note names, content changes)
- Fixed misleading save status indicators that showed "saved" when changes were lost
- Improved user trust with accurate feedback on save operations
- Enhanced debugging capabilities with comprehensive logging

**Solution Implemented**: 
- Added handleAttachmentNodeUpdatedEvent function to capture attachment changes
- Registered attachment-node-updated event listener in useUnifiedStorage.ts
- Enhanced logging to show frame state before force save operations
- Verified fix handles text, video, and PDF attachment property changes

**Next Steps**: 
- ‚úÖ Fix verified and ready for user testing
- Monitor attachment workflows across all attachment types
- User validation of save behavior for note name changes
