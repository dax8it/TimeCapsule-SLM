⏺ I see the issue! The output is showing duplicate "45 minutes" entries. Let me
  first update the Issue-008 document and then investigate the parsing problem.

⏺ Now let me investigate the duplicate output issue. The problem seems to be in the
  content parsing where "completed in 45 minutes" is being parsed incorrectly:

⏺ Read(src/lib/multi-agent/agents/ExtractionAgent.ts)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I see the issue. When the LLM returns something like "completed in 45 minutes",
  it's being stored with both the full content and the time value. Then in the
  SynthesisAgent, we're appending the time value again. Let me check the
  SynthesisAgent:

⏺ Read(src/lib/multi-agent/agents/SynthesisAgent.ts)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I found the issue! When the content already contains the time (like "completed in
  45 minutes"), we're appending the time value again. Let me fix the SynthesisAgent
  to check if the content already contains the time value:
