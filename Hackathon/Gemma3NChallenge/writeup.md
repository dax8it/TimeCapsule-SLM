TimeCapsule-SLM


Revolutionizing Education & Open Learning  with Gemma 3n
Just as coding agents have revolutionized the way developers write code, TimeCapsuleSLM is set to revolutionize the way we learn. Our platform is a comprehensive, open-source solution that combines AI-powered research and adaptive learning tools into a single, cohesive experience. By leveraging the on-device, completely offline capabilities of Gemma 3n, we're building a solution that creates meaningful, positive change, especially in underserved educational settings.

Our Vision
Our vision is to solve open learning. In an era of fragmented information, learners and researchers face a common set of challenges: inefficient learning methods and a lack of privacy-first, on-device AI tools. Traditional learning is often linear and lacks the personalization needed for individual students, while educators are burdened with manual content creation. In low-resource environments with limited internet access and hardware, these challenges are magnified.
Our vision is to empower individuals and communities with a powerful, accessible, and private AI platform. TimeCapsuleSLM addresses these issues head-on by providing an intelligent, offline-first solution that puts the user in control of their data and learning journey.


The Critical Problem We're Solving
The Global Education Crisis & the need to upskill
lack access to quality educational resources due to connectivity, infrastructure, and economic barriers.
Poor teacher to student ratio
Current AI education tools require constant internet connectivity, expensive hardware, and cloud-based processing that compromises privacy. They fail precisely where they're needed most - in underserved communities with limited resources.




How We Use Gemma 3n: A Technical Deep Dive
TimeCapsuleSLM is built to leverage the unique capabilities of Google's Gemma 3n model, making it a powerful, privacy-first, and entirely offline solution.
On-Device Performance and Privacy
At the core of our platform is the ability to run powerful AI models locally, completely offline. By integrating with Ollama, we serve Gemma 3n directly on a user's device. This aligns perfectly with Gemma 3n's design philosophy of on-device, private AI. All data processing for research, document indexing, and learning assistance happens locally, ensuring user data never leaves their device.
Gemma 3n's Mix'n'Match for Optimized Performance
We leverage Gemma 3n's innovative "mix'n'match" capability to dynamically optimize performance. We've achieved this with our custom-developed Timecapsule2.7B-g3n-mix-match model, which we created and published on Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/bubblspace/Timecapsule2.7B-g3n-mix-match. This allows us to tailor the model's memory footprint and processing speed, making it highly efficient even on resource-constrained devices.

Overcoming Technical Challenges: The Power of AI Agents and Regex Search
Traditional semantic search, while powerful, can often produce poor, ungrounded results in resource-constrained, offline environments. We recognized that true document analysis requires a smarter approach. We needed to build a system that could understand a user's intent and then precisely extract relevant information from documents, not just provide loosely related text.
We took inspiration from the success of coding agents and built a similar multi-agent system for learning and discovery, but one that is grounded in actual document truth. Our approach is a direct solution to this problem, leveraging Gemma 3n's on-device intelligence.
Hereâ€™s how our unique approach works:
Document Inspector: When a user poses a query, a specialized agent, the Document Inspector, first analyzes all available documents in the user's local Knowledge Base. Its job is to use Gemma 3n to determine which specific document or documents are most relevant to the user's intent. This ensures the subsequent search is targeted and efficient.
Planning Agent and Regex Search: After the correct document is identified, a Planning Agent kicks in. Instead of relying on a resource-intensive semantic search, this agent uses Gemma 3n to generate a precise Regex search pattern based on the user's query and the document's content. This Regex is then executed on the raw text of the chosen document. This method provides several key advantages:
Precision and Grounding: The Regex search guarantees that the extracted text is directly from the source document, providing a high degree of truthfulness.
Resource Efficiency: Regex operations are significantly faster and less computationally intensive than semantic search, making them perfect for offline, on-device execution.
Fallback Mechanism: While our primary method is this highly precise Regex search, we do use Gemma 3n's raw LLM discovery as a fallback mechanism for broader, more open-ended queries where a precise Regex pattern cannot be formulated. This ensures we can still provide a useful response while prioritizing the accuracy and efficiency of our Regex-based approach.
This agentic behavior, powered by Gemma 3n, allows us to build a robust in-browser Knowledge Base that can drive a powerful DeepResearch platform. By uploading documents to their local Knowledge Base, users can trust that the insights generated are not only relevant but also grounded in their own data, all while being fast and private.

The Impact: A New Paradigm for Learning
TimeCapsuleSLM represents a significant step towards democratizing education and research. By using Gemma 3n to bring powerful AI capabilities on-device and entirely offline, we've created a platform that empowers both teachers and students. The AI-Frames system transforms passive content into interactive, graphical learning experiences, and our unique multi-agent system provides grounded, precise research outputs. Most importantly, our solution provides a cost-effective, private, and accessible platform for teachers and students in low-resource environments. We are enabling a future where quality education is not limited by location, connectivity, or access to expensive hardware.
